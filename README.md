# Java
# Customer

A customer can make reservations for flights.

A customer can go to a search engine (= GUI) to look up available airlines and flights and fares.

Alternatively, a customer can go directly to the “web page” (= GUI) of an airline and make a reservation there.

A customer can also cancel a reservation.

A customer must have a password protected account.

A customer can pull up a read-only GUI to display all his/her reservations.

A customer is not allowed to see data for other customers.

# Airline

An airline must have a “web page” (= GUI) which displays all its flights and fares.

An airline administrator can insert additional flights/fares and/or cancel flights.

Customers can only read the flight/fares information but cannot edit it.

Customers can make reservations (and cancel) using an airline’s “web page” (= GUI).

Each flight has a max capacity (set by the airline administrator).

If a flight is full, customers cannot make reservations for that flight.

An airline must have a read-only GUI which displays all the reservations made by all the customers.

This GUI can be read only by an airline administrator, not by customers.

If a flight is cancelled, the accounts of all customers with bookings on that flight must be updated to indicate their

reservation was cancelled.
